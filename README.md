# Kolours

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjoberg/kolours.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bjoberg/kolours)

Kolours is a web app that lets you play with your favorite background colors. 

A personal design project, my goal with Kolours was to create the simplest, most robust, and documented web application I could. Kolours doesn't do much, but with this project I attempted to move out of my comfort zone and learn how to build a real piece of software.
